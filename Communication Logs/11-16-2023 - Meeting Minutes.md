    - Assigned Sophia to extend the keyboard example into more specific cases
        - Besides our current code that listens to WASD and the Arrow Keys, we need one new file that only listens to WASD, and another new file that only listens to the Arrow Keys.
    - Steven is to finally create his own branch.
        - Not everyone on the team was well-experienced in using GitHub and git. Joey will likely be helping Steven set this up over the weekend.
    - Joey is going to be figuring out how to install Doxygen on Saturday. Joey and Nate will be meeting at 1:00 PM at the Dunbar Library on Sunday to get Doxygen set up on Nate's computer as well.
