    - Nate walked us through the list of requirements that we still need to hit, and helped isolate our largest remaining to-do's to make the professor happy.

- TODO
    - Joey needs to go through our past meeting minutes and link to pertinent commits and pull requests to improve our "traceability."
    - Steven and Joey will work on Merging Steven's score-drawing code into Joey's dev branch. (commit: [Merging Steven's score prototype](https://github.com/WSU-DGscheidle/fall-2023-team08_atomic_coders/pull/20/commits/ae0aa736909c5e68d6e09efaf26f75bed4417e12))
    - Zayd and Joey will be adding some Tests to the repo to run some automated checks on intended behavior.
    - Sophia and Joey will be meeting on Saturday to help get Sophia up to the 20-commit minimum, as well as add Documentation to the repo.
    - We do not have the 15 minimum User Stories, and Joey has also not submitted any user stories. This must be rectified.
