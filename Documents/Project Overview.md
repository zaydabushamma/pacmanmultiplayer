Project Overview
========

### Project Title
- Pac-Man

### Team Name
- Team 8: Atomic Coders

### Team Members
- Zayd Abushamma
- Steven Cao
- Sophia Gyamfuah
- Nathaniel Ryan
- Joey Sodergren

### Project Synopsis
- We plan to implement a clone or imitation of the original Pac-Man arcade game. We're targeting computers (that is to say, not phones), and we're planning on using Java.

### Concept of Operation
- The game should run in a window, featuring a pixel art graphical output. Pac-Man should be controllable using the arrow keys or WASD. Ghost behavior, score keeping, and the general rules of play should be functionally identical to those of the original arcade game.

### Estimate of Effort
- Ballpark 60 hours per team member, across the entire project duration. This will definitely vary per member and also depending on how difficult this turns out to be.
